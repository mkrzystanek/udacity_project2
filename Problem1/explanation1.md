###### Time complexity:
**get() method:**

O(1), because it involves reading a value from hash map (O(1)) and
moving linked list node to the head position (O(1)).

**set() method**

O(1), because it involves adding new element to linked list and 
to hash map, which are both of constant complexity. In some cases,
it also involves removing an element form hash map and linked list,
but these operations are also O(1).

###### Sace complexity:
