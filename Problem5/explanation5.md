###### Time complexity:
**add() method:**

O(1), because it involves adding new element to a linked list, which has a constant number of operations.

**print_chain() method**

O(n), because it involves traversing every element of the list.

**\_\_str()\_\_ method**
O(n), because it involves traversing every element if the list.

###### Sace complexity:

**add() method:**

O(1), because it operates with constant number of variables.

**print_chain() method**

O(1), while it traverses all elements in the list, only one variable is held in memory at the time.

**\_\_str()\_\_ method**
O(n), because it creates a list that will hold every element of linked list in memory
